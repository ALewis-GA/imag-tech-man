=================

.. include:: ../../shared/variables.rst

Unless otherwise noted, INTERMAGNET data are provided to users
under a Creative Commons Attributions-NonCommercial 4.0 
International Licence (CC BY-NC 4.0). Some institutes
contributing data to INTERMAGNET may do so under 
different licence arrangments. 

- If data are required for commercial use, sale or bulk 
  distribution you must obtain written permission directly  
  from the institute operating the observatory. Check the 
  INTERMAGNET web site (|intermagnet_website|) for contact
  details and any specific institute licence conditions.
- Any report or publication making use of INTERMAGNET data
  should acknowledge the relevant institutes as the source of 
  data. The preferred method for acknowledgement is to cite
  the relevant Digital Object Identifier (DOI). DOIs are not
  yet available for some older data so INTERMAGNET provides 
  two suggested forms of acknowledgement for those data, 
  see :numref:`use_dat_cond_use_ack`.
- We ask that either an electronic link to, or paper copy of, 
  each report or publication is sent to those institutes
  whose data you use.
- We also ask that a citation reference is sent to the 
  INTERMAGNET Secretary |contact|.

Your email address, which you provide to INTERMAGNET when
requesting data, may be given to the institute supplying the
data so that it can monitor data usage.

By accessing data from INTERMAGNET you signify your acceptance
of these terms and conditions. For commercial applications of
observatory data, you must contact the operating institute
directly.

INTERMAGNET accepts no liability in respect of
loss, damage, injury or other occurrence arising from
the provision of these data.
